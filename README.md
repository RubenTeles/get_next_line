# get_next_line

The get_next_line project is an essential component of the curriculum at the 42 programming school, focusing on file manipulation and input/output handling in C.

In the get_next_line project, I have developed a function in the C programming language called get_next_line. This function allows for reading a complete line from a file or standard input.

The get_next_line function is designed to handle various file descriptors, including regular files, standard input (stdin), and even network connections.

The implementation of get_next_line utilizes concepts such as dynamic memory allocation, buffer reading, and pointer manipulation in C.

By using small blocks of buffers, the get_next_line function reads the file or standard input and returns the read line until it encounters a newline character ('\n') or reaches the end of the file.

Through the get_next_line project, I have honed my skills in file manipulation, buffer reading, memory management, and pointer manipulation in the C programming language.

The get_next_line function serves as a valuable tool for efficiently reading data line by line in programs dealing with text files or user input.
